# Car-Management-System
This project utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) model and traversal algorithms to retrieve, insert, remove, and manage cars from a used car dealership. All cars have a make, model, year, and price, which can be used to determine the value of cars in relation to each other. The BST sorts the nodes by make and model. Within each node, car objects are added to a Python list based on their insertion order. The project also returns the best and worst cars based on the year and price. I worked on this project for my Intermediate Python class in Spring 2023.
